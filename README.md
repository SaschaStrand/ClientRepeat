Status Report for OSS Project
as of 2017-07-12

My work on the initial version of this project was moving concurrently with the topics covered in the full stack web development course I'm also taking this summer.

Progess slowed when we began learning javascript and the bootstrap framework, as I realized the work I was beginning to do manaually could be better done with the templates and more automated processes discussed in just this last week.

So far I have only a rough, single-page front-end to my OSS project, and I intend to rebuild that with the bootstrap framework this upcoming week. Then, as my web dev class finishes our module on server-side work at the start of next week, I will begin building the back end.

My goal is to have a limited but working front and back end by the end of the day on Sunday, July 23rd.

That way I can take full advantage of the work days alloted in our course time the following two weeks to build out the feature sets that will begin to make this application a valuable summer project.
